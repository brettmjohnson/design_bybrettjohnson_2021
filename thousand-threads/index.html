          <p class="section-description">Early in user testing, many people were getting lost in the world, unsure of what direction to head next. To solve this problem, I designed a compass with markers that would help point users toward their goals.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="caption-heading">A flawed early version</h3>
            <p>mimicked a traditional circle compass, but included a marker to point you toward your current goal. As the you got closer to your goal, the marker would grow until it encircled the compass to show you'd reached the destination. While this worked well initially, as more goal types were added, the additional markers overwhelmed the design.</p>

            <h3 class="caption-heading">The solution</h3>
            <p>was to build on a well-established design found in many large, successful open world games—the compass bar. The markers, now colored symbols, point to the precise direction of the goal. And from the circle compass, I adapted the expanding rings into filling bars. The result is something more immediately understandable for many users. And with the intuitive innovation found in the filling bars, there’s a substantial improvement to navigation.</p>

            <p>for communicating a character’s relation to a goal and state is to place symbols above their head. I designed a library of icons for the various needs, along with the logic for which to display in any given situation.</p>

            <p>for the goal markers provides a small but significant improvement to the experience. “You helped Elmer.” “Retrieve items from Bill.” “Deliver mail to Hannah.” By integrating the explanation of the goal with the character’s name, the user is quickly reminded of what the marker means and clued in on the type of action to take.</p>

            <p>for item selection, the radial menu, forced me to explore other options. With a radial menu, you use a joystick or mouse to gesture from the center toward the item in the ring you want to select. While this worked well initially, the addition of multiple ammo types for the slingshot and rifle complicated and overwhelmed the design.</p>

            <p>was built in this linear selection system. On the horizontal axis, you select the item, while on the vertical you choose the ammo, when it’s available. The result is something immediately understandable to new players. And with its contextually revealed components, ammo crafting was easily integrated late in development.</p>
